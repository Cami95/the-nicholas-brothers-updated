      They grew up in Philadelphia and were the sons of two musicians who played
      in their own band at the old standard theater. Their mother played piano
      while their father played the drums. From a young age, the brothers where
      exposed to alot of Vaudeville acts but they specificly showed interest in
      the dancers. These acts included notable talents such as Alice Whitman,
      Willie Bryant and Bill Robinson.Even with this being the case, they never
      had an formal dance training.
