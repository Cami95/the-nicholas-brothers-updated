          "One day at the Standard Theater in Philadelphia, I looked onstage and
          I thought, 'They're having fun up there; I'd like to do something like
          that.' We worked up an act called 'The Nicholas Kids,' and did it in
          the living room."- Fayard Nicholas

          "We can't do those routines any more; we don't want to, and I'll tell
          you why--it hurts!"

          "My brother and I used our whole bodies, our hands, our personalities
          and everything. We tried to make it classic. We called our type of
          dancing classical tap and we just hoped the audience liked it."

          "Our father said, "When you're dancing, don't look at your feet, look
          at the audience. You're not entertaining yourself, you're entertaining
          the audience"."

      They grew up in Philadelphia and were the sons of two musicians who played
      in their own band at the old standard theater. Their mother played piano
      while their father played the drums. From a young age, the brothers where
      exposed to alot of Vaudeville acts but they specificly showed interest in
      the dancers. These acts included notable talents such as Alice Whitman,
      Willie Bryant and Bill Robinson.Even with this being the case, they never
      had an formal dance training.
